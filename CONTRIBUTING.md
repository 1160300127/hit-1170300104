### Finding open issues

We use a few labels to organize issues across all of the repositories:

“help wanted” for any issues with which the core team would like help
“easy” for issues the core team thinks are good for someone who’s new to contributing
“documentation” for issues related to documenting the APIs
“design” for issues that could use a designer’s expertise
“p0”, “p1”, “p2”, etc. for prioritizing issues
